# TORTIS

![image](logo.svg)

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/419032705.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/419032705)

TORTIS is an extension of Rust that adds functionality for real-time software transactional memory without retries. TORTIS extends the Rust compiler to recognize the ‚Äútransaction‚Äù key word, and provides automatic synchronization of shared objects within transactions.  To do so, it extends the Rust type system to include TxPointer and TxCell types which wrap shared objects. An additional pass is added to the compiler to determine what shared objects are used within a transaction, and emit calls to the runtime locking library that TORTIS provides.  The runtime library is modular and supports many different synchronization primitives.  Currently, a phase-fair reader-writer lock is used.  

The main source code repository for [Rust] contains the compiler, standard library, and documentation.
[Rust]: https://www.rust-lang.org

What follows are our build instructions, documentation on our source changes, and the standard Rust README.  

## Building

```bash
cargo +stage1 build
```

## Running tests

Run tests with `TXN=true cargo +stage1 test`.

The `RUSTC_LOG` environment variable sets the log level per package with
`RUSTC_LOG=$package=$level`, e.g.
`RUSTC_LOG=rustc_mir::transform::transaction=debug`.
The log levels are `warn`, `debug`, and `info`.

Output logs to a file with `|& tee out.log`.

Get backtrace information on panic with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1`.

All together:

```bash
RUSTC_LOG=rustc_mir::transform::transaction=debug TXN=true RUST_BACKTRACE=1 cargo +stage1 test
```

The test binaries are cached, so if you rebuild the compiler you'll need to rebuild the binary manually. I usually do `cargo clean` and then `cargo +stage1 test` again, or specifically delete my desired binary at `target/debug/deps/test-name-012345` where 012345 is some hash, then rebuild.

## Performance Evaluation

Get test data by enabling debug output with `-- --nocapture`.

```bash
TXN=true cargo +stage1 test linear -- --nocapture
```

## Viewing MIR

`.cargo/config` ensures that `cargo` commands emit MIR by default.

MIR will be located in:

```bash
target/debug/deps/$filename-$hash.mir
```

# `transaction` keyword

AST-level changes are mostly in `libsyntax` and `libsyntax_pos`. Search around for `transaction` and you should find my changes.

## Core

`src/libsyntax/ast.rs` adds `TransactionBlock`, `Lock`, and `Unlock` types to the enum.

`src/libsyntax_pos/symbol.rs` adds `kw::Transaction` to the list of symbols.

`src/libsyntax/parse/parser/expr.rs` parses the block if it sees `kw::Transaction`.

## Misc. other files

These are mostly just filling out enums.

`src/libsyntax/mut_visit.rs`

`src/libsyntax/parse/classify.rs`

`src/libsyntax/parse/token.rs`

`src/libsyntax/print/pprust.rs`

`src/libsyntax/util/parser.rs`

`src/libsyntax/visit.rs`

# Lowering `ast::ExprKind::TransactionBlock` to `hir::ExprKind::Lock` and `hir::ExprKind::Unlock`

These changes are mostly in `rustc::hir::lowering`.

`src/librustc/hir/lowering.rs` is the key code that lowers from a `TransactionBlock` to a `Lock` and `Unlock` surrounding a block.

`src/librustc/hir/lowering/expr.rs` also has a bit of glue.

## Misc. other files

These are mostly just filling out enums.

`src/librustc/hir/intravisit.rs`

`src/librustc/hir/mod.rs`

`src/librustc/hir/print.rs`

`src/librustc/middle/expr_use_visitor.rs`

`src/librustc/middle/mem_categorization.rs`

`src/librustc_passes/liveness.rs`

`src/librustc_typeck/check/expr.rs`

# Lowering to HAIR

HAIR is High-level Abstract Intermediate Representation, which is this kind of small middle step between HIR and MIR.

`src/librustc_mir/hair/cx/expr.rs` has the TORTIS implementation.

Most of these changes are in `rustc_mir::transform`, in particular `rustc_mir::transform::transaction`.

`src/librustc/mir/mod.rs` contains new struct definitions so they can be imported across the compiler. Note that `rustc/mir/` and `rustc_mir/` exist at this point in the compiler because the compiler team was in the process of making it more modular. üòõ 

# Queries

`src/librustc/query/mod.rs` defines TORTIS's new queries. It's a big macro, so follow the template. See the [rustc dev guide chapter on queries](https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/query.html) for more details.

We had to add `#[derive(Eq, PartialEq, Hash)]` to some structs so that they can be used in the query system. The query system needs these properties for memoization.

`src/librustc/mir/interpret/error.rs` has some other misc. structs that needed new `#[derive]`s.

# Emit lock calls

`src/librustc_mir/transform/mod.rs` implements the query functions and applies the patches that insert lock calls. It uses the `rustc_mir::transform::transaction` modules.

`src/librustc_mir/transform/transaction/mod.rs` contains some other helper functions for patching the lock calls.

# Def-use analysis

`src/librustc_mir/transform/transaction/transaction_map.rs` maps function calls to the transactions in which they are contained.

`src/librustc_mir/transform/transaction/use_def_analysis.rs` is the main def-use analysis. It imports `TransactionMap`.

# Conflict analysis

`src/librustc_mir/transform/transaction/conflict_analysis.rs` performs conflict analysis.

# Lang items

`src/librustc/middle/lang_items.rs` is where new lang items are created. It's a big macro, so just follow the template.

# Compiler config

`src/librustc/session/config.rs` lets you set compiler flags. TORTIS creates the `transaction_level` compiler flag. It is later checked at the MIR stage.

Set `transaction_level` in `.cargo/config`.

```bash
$ pwd
/home/ubuntu/dev/transactional-memory/txcell
$ cat .cargo/config
[build]
rustflags = ["--emit", "mir", "-Z", "transaction_level=2"]
```

## Installing RUST from Source

_Note: If you wish to contribute to the compiler, you should read [this
chapter][rustcguidebuild] of the rustc-guide instead of this section._

The Rust build system has a Python script called `x.py` to bootstrap building
the compiler. More information about it may be found by running `./x.py --help`
or reading the [rustc guide][rustcguidebuild].

[rustcguidebuild]: https://rust-lang.github.io/rustc-guide/how-to-build-and-run.html

### Building on *nix
1. Make sure you have installed the dependencies:

   * `g++` 5.1 or later or `clang++` 3.5 or later
   * `python` 2.7 (but not 3.x)
   * GNU `make` 3.81 or later
   * `cmake` 3.4.3 or later
   * `curl`
   * `git`
   * `ssl` which comes in `libssl-dev` or `openssl-devel`
   * `pkg-config` if you are compiling on Linux and targeting Linux

2. Clone the [source] with `git`:

   ```sh
   $ git clone https://github.com/rust-lang/rust.git
   $ cd rust
   ```

[source]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust

3. Configure the build settings:

    The Rust build system uses a file named `config.toml` in the root of the
    source tree to determine various configuration settings for the build.
    Copy the default `config.toml.example` to `config.toml` to get started.

    ```sh
    $ cp config.toml.example config.toml
    ```

    It is recommended that if you plan to use the Rust build system to create
    an installation (using `./x.py install`) that you set the `prefix` value
    in the `[install]` section to a directory that you have write permissions.

    Create install directory if you are not installing in default directory

4. Build and install:

    ```sh
    $ ./x.py build && ./x.py install
    ```

    When complete, `./x.py install` will place several programs into
    `$PREFIX/bin`: `rustc`, the Rust compiler, and `rustdoc`, the
    API-documentation tool. This install does not include [Cargo],
    Rust's package manager. To build and install Cargo, you may
    run `./x.py install cargo` or set the `build.extended` key in
    `config.toml` to `true` to build and install all tools.

[Cargo]: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo

### Building on Windows

There are two prominent ABIs in use on Windows: the native (MSVC) ABI used by
Visual Studio, and the GNU ABI used by the GCC toolchain. Which version of Rust
you need depends largely on what C/C++ libraries you want to interoperate with:
for interop with software produced by Visual Studio use the MSVC build of Rust;
for interop with GNU software built using the MinGW/MSYS2 toolchain use the GNU
build.

#### MinGW

[MSYS2][msys2] can be used to easily build Rust on Windows:

[msys2]: https://msys2.github.io/

1. Grab the latest [MSYS2 installer][msys2] and go through the installer.

2. Run `mingw32_shell.bat` or `mingw64_shell.bat` from wherever you installed
   MSYS2 (i.e. `C:\msys64`), depending on whether you want 32-bit or 64-bit
   Rust. (As of the latest version of MSYS2 you have to run `msys2_shell.cmd
   -mingw32` or `msys2_shell.cmd -mingw64` from the command line instead)

3. From this terminal, install the required tools:

   ```sh
   # Update package mirrors (may be needed if you have a fresh install of MSYS2)
   $ pacman -Sy pacman-mirrors

   # Install build tools needed for Rust. If you're building a 32-bit compiler,
   # then replace "x86_64" below with "i686". If you've already got git, python,
   # or CMake installed and in PATH you can remove them from this list. Note
   # that it is important that you do **not** use the 'python2' and 'cmake'
   # packages from the 'msys2' subsystem. The build has historically been known
   # to fail with these packages.
   $ pacman -S git \
               make \
               diffutils \
               tar \
               mingw-w64-x86_64-python2 \
               mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake \
               mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc
   ```

4. Navigate to Rust's source code (or clone it), then build it:

   ```sh
   $ ./x.py build && ./x.py install
   ```

#### MSVC

MSVC builds of Rust additionally require an installation of Visual Studio 2017
(or later) so `rustc` can use its linker.  The simplest way is to get the
[Visual Studio], check the ‚ÄúC++ build tools‚Äù and ‚ÄúWindows 10 SDK‚Äù workload.

[Visual Studio]: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/

(If you're installing cmake yourself, be careful that ‚ÄúC++ CMake tools for
Windows‚Äù doesn't get included under ‚ÄúIndividual components‚Äù.)

With these dependencies installed, you can build the compiler in a `cmd.exe`
shell with:

```sh
> python x.py build
```

Currently, building Rust only works with some known versions of Visual Studio. If
you have a more recent version installed the build system doesn't understand
then you may need to force rustbuild to use an older version. This can be done
by manually calling the appropriate vcvars file before running the bootstrap.

```batch
> CALL "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvars64.bat"
> python x.py build
```

### Building rustc with older host toolchains
It is still possible to build Rust with the older toolchain versions listed below, but only if the
LLVM_TEMPORARILY_ALLOW_OLD_TOOLCHAIN option is set to true in the config.toml file.

* Clang 3.1
* Apple Clang 3.1
* GCC 4.8
* Visual Studio 2015 (Update 3)

Toolchain versions older than what is listed above cannot be used to build rustc.

#### Specifying an ABI

Each specific ABI can also be used from either environment (for example, using
the GNU ABI in PowerShell) by using an explicit build triple. The available
Windows build triples are:
- GNU ABI (using GCC)
    - `i686-pc-windows-gnu`
    - `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`
- The MSVC ABI
    - `i686-pc-windows-msvc`
    - `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`

The build triple can be specified by either specifying `--build=<triple>` when
invoking `x.py` commands, or by copying the `config.toml` file (as described
in [Installing From Source](#installing-from-source)), and modifying the
`build` option under the `[build]` section.

### Configure and Make

While it's not the recommended build system, this project also provides a
configure script and makefile (the latter of which just invokes `x.py`).

```sh
$ ./configure
$ make && sudo make install
```

When using the configure script, the generated `config.mk` file may override the
`config.toml` file. To go back to the `config.toml` file, delete the generated
`config.mk` file.

## Building Documentation

If you‚Äôd like to build the documentation, it‚Äôs almost the same:

```sh
$ ./x.py doc
```

The generated documentation will appear under `doc` in the `build` directory for
the ABI used. I.e., if the ABI was `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`, the directory will be
`build\x86_64-pc-windows-msvc\doc`.

## Notes

Since the Rust compiler is written in Rust, it must be built by a
precompiled "snapshot" version of itself (made in an earlier stage of
development). As such, source builds require a connection to the Internet, to
fetch snapshots, and an OS that can execute the available snapshot binaries.

Snapshot binaries are currently built and tested on several platforms:

| Platform / Architecture    | x86 | x86_64 |
|----------------------------|-----|--------|
| Windows (7, 8, 10, ...)    | ‚úì   | ‚úì      |
| Linux (2.6.18 or later)    | ‚úì   | ‚úì      |
| macOS (10.7 Lion or later) | ‚úì   | ‚úì      |

You may find that other platforms work, but these are our officially
supported build environments that are most likely to work.
